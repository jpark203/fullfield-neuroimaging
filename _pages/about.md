### **Welcome!**

#### This website is to share specs and information about our full-field neuroimaging setup, which allows us to project images up to 175 deg visual angle in the MRI scanner. 

<br>
#### If you want to get full-field setup in your center, here are the main componenet you need. 
  - #### Image Projection
  - #### Screen
  - #### Stimuli
  - #### Image Warping

<br>
#### Each key component of the setup has its own page, where you can find information about the design, materials, and images. 

<br> 
#### Note that these are just brief description of what / how / why things are designed the way they are, as a starting point for anyone who wants to build their own setup.

<br>
#### If you'd like to ask any questions, or want to receive updates on the setup, please consider joining our Google Groups. A link to the group will be shown once you fill out the form [HERE](https://forms.gle/mDy1PMJv11Trk1uW8).
