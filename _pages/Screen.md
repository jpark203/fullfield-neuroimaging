<blockquote style="background-color: #f2e6ff;">
<strong><em>Key Idea</em></strong> : 
Get the maximum screen real estate for a given scanner bore size, with constraints that 1) the screen must remain stable against the scanner vibration, 2) image should look crisp and clear, and 3) the screen should be easy to setup and remove.

#### **Design**
<div style="padding: 10px;">
    <img src="../images/ScreenHull.JPG" alt="screen hull" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Screen hull</em></figcaption>
</div>
- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> The screen was held in shape by gluing it to a using a custom fabricated acrylic “hull” that could be placed over the subject’s head and guided into the bore with them.

- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Design Files: download
[.ipt](../designFiles/2020FlatDesign.ipt)
,
[.dxf](../designFiles/screenHull.dxf)
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The original back brace cast an unwanted shadow and was replaced with the lower profile one shown floating in front. A new back bracket, consistent with this design, has been added to the dxf file. </span>

#### **Materials**
- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Screen Sheet (not shown): [polystyrene](https://www.mcmaster.com/8734K39/)</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any material is fine. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> We found some plastics had a green fluorescence when illuminated by the projector. Polystyrene did not, resulted in a reasonably crisp image and was easily glued to the hull ribs. </span>

- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Screen Hull: white acrylic 1/4'' (6mm)</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any non-magnetic material can work. We chose acrylic becasue it was easy to iterate prototypes with our laser cutter. </span>

- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Plastic Rod: 1/4' [polystyrene rod](https://www.mcmaster.com/8720K32/) </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The rod is passed through hull ribs to maintain spacing and enforce rigidity. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Any plastic should be fine. </span>

- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Glue: acrylic solvent (Weld-On #3 or #16)</span>

- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Adjustable "legs": attached with 1/4''-20 nylon screws </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Hull is tapped. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The legs slot into the MRI bed. </span>
