- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> Stimuli were 1024 x 768 pixels 2D images, which were captured via a camera in virtual reality environments.</span>

<br>
- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> All VR environments were generated using the Unity game engine (Version 2017.3.0).</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> All rooms had the same physical dimensions (4 width x 3 height x 6 depth arbitrary units).</span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Each environment has an extended horizontal surface along the back wall, containing a centrally positioned object. Then, the room was additionally populated with the kinds of objects typically encountered in those locations, creating naturalistic computer generated images. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> These environments were also used in Park, Josephs, & Konkle 
    ([2021](https://psyarxiv.com/84exs);
    [2022](https://konklab.fas.harvard.edu/Papers/Park_2022_SciReports.pdf)). </span>


<br>
- <span style="font-size: 22px;"> For each environment, we rendered an image view. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The camera parameters were set to mimic the view of an adult standing in a room looking at the object on the back counter/surface. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> If the camara parameters were not right to feel as if you were standing in the room with objects having their familiar sizes, viewers were prone to experience distortions of space. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The height was set to be 1.6 (arbitrary units), and the angle was tilted down (about 5.2 deg) such that the center object was always at the center of the image. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> The camera filed-of-view (FOV) was fixed at 120.2 width x 105 height degrees. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> This FOV was chosen based on the chord angle of our physical screen (120 deg) and empirical testing by experimenters. </span>
    - <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Since there was no ground truth for the size of VR environments (e.g., how large the space should be), experimenters compared a few different FOVs and made subjective judgements on which parameter feels most natural. </span>
