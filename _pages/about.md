### **Welcome!**

<br>
#### This website is to share specs and information about our full-field neuroimaging setup, which allows us to project images up to 175 deg visual angle in the MRI scanner. 

<br>
#### Each key component of the setup has its own page, where you can find information about the design, materials, and images. 

<br>
#### Note that these are just brief description of what / how / why things are designed the way they are, as a starting point for anyone who wants to build their own setup.

<br>
#### Please feel free to sign up for the email list below to receive updates on the website and the setup. 
#### If you have any questions, please ask us via the email list. 
#### We will try to answer the questions we have answers to, and update the FAQ page as necessary.
